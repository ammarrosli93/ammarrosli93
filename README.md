##  About Me

I am a **career-switching Junior Web Developer** with a background in **Mechanical–Automotive Engineering** and over **three years of experience in administrative and systems-based roles**. Through my previous work, I was exposed to data workflows, dashboards, and process optimisation, which sparked my transition into software development.

I have completed **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and I am currently learning **React**, focusing on building practical, real-world applications. My long-term goal is to grow into a **Full Stack Developer** and eventually progress into **DevOps / cloud-oriented engineering**.

I enjoy understanding how systems work end-to-end, translating requirements into working applications, and continuously improving through hands-on projects.
